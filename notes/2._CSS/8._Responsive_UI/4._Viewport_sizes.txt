====== 4. Viewport sizes ======
Created Tuesday 01 September 2020

* Percentages in size are relative to the parent container.
* If we need to define size relative to the device's display at all times, use viewport sizes.
* There are four of them:
	1. vw - view width
	2. vh - view height
	3. vmin - minimum of the height and width
	4. vmax - maximum of the height and width
