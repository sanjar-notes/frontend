====== 15. display and visibility ======
Created Tuesday 16 June 2020

display: Assume that the element is absent.
There are 3 options: none, inline, block
* Most elements have a predfined, default value.
* Can be used to remove elements by setting dislay:none without removing them.
--------------------
Visibility: The element just went blind.
* visibility:none, just makes the element contents hidden, it still takes the screen real estate.
