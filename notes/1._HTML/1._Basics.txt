* HTML specifies the basic structure(skeleton) of the webpage.
* HTML is a markup language, not a programming language.
* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language

=== Tags ===
* The atomic unit of an element is the tag.
* There are two kinds of tags
	a. Content tags(or just tags)
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<p> HTML is genius </p>
}}}

	b. Self closing(or empty tags)
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<img />
}}}


=== Attributes ===
* An attribute is a key-value pairs used for modifying a tag.
* They are written inside the angled brackets, not in the content.
* Syntax:
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<img height="200px" width="200px" />
}}}

* keys are strings(without spaces). No quotes.
* values are strings. Quotes are recommended.
* = is used for assigning values to key.
Note: "true"/"false", i.e boolean attribute values can be ommitted. Presence of a boolean attribute means it is enabled.
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<video autoplay /> <!-- better -->
<video autoplay="true" /> <!-- same -->
}}}


=== Anatomy of a webpage ===
* ''<!DOCTYPE html>'' is a mandatory "preamble".
* There are 3 basic tags in all webages.
	1. ''html'' - encloses the whole webpage.
	2. ''head'' - contains title(tab title) and page metadata. Used by crawlers.
	3. ''body'' - webpage content, as seen in the browser.
* Basic structure of a webpage.
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

	<head>
	</head>
	
	<body>
	</body>
	
</html>
}}}

* Everything inside the body is perceptible in the browser(below the omnibox).

=== Other basic tags ===
* ''title'' - appears on the tab. Page file name is displayed if this is absent. Used within ''head''.
* ''meta'' - describes various types of metadata like language, region, character encoding.

=== Facts about HTML ===
* Errors are ignored by the browser.
* Whitespace is ignored in the content of HTML tags, except in string literals.
* HTML does not have strict indentation, it is free flow language.
