====== 7. Containers ======
Created Tuesday 01 September 2020

Apart from the standard container, we have 2 custom containers.
1. <**div**></**div**> - block level container
2. <**span**></**span**> - inline level container(stacks horizontally)

* According to the box model, both div and span change width w.r.t the content. It is not that a div is fully extended.
