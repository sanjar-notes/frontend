* HTML specifies the basic structure(skelton) of the webpage.
* HTML is a markup language, not a programming language.
* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language

=== Basic syntax ===
* We have the <head> and the <body> inside the <html>
* DOCTYPE is like a shebang.
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
}}}

* Everything inside the body is perceptible in the browser(below the omnibox).

=== Facts about HTML ===
* Errors are ignored by the browser
* Whitespace is ignored in content in HTML tags, except in string literals.
* HTML does not have strict indentation, it is free flow language.
