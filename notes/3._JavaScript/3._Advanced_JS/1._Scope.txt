====== 1. Scope ======
Created Tuesday 14 July 2020

There are two scopes in JS:
1. Global scope - variables/functions defined outside of any class/function. There is only one global scope.
2. Local scope - variables  defined inside a function/class.
3. **Root Scope** - window
	By default we are in the window(the tab) scope. This is also called the root scope.
