====== 0. JS Setup ======
Created Tuesday 14 July 2020

=== **No-setup method** ===
* Open developer tool
* Write JS in console

=== **Dedicated setup** ===
* JavaScript needs the ''node'' interpreter to run outside the browser. 
* ''node'' is the official name, but ''nodejs'' is more common.

**Steps for installing node**
1. Install **nvm**: easy to update/manage node versions. Similar to pyenv.
2. Install ''node'' using **nvm** by running the following command
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
nvm install latest_version --lts
}}}

3. npm comes bundled with ''node''
4. check version using ''node -v''

Note: 
* Node is similar to the Python interpreter.
* ''node'' is used for summoning the JavaScript REPL, at a CLI.
