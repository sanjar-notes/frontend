====== 3. Basic JavaScript ======
Created Wednesday 08 July 2020

**Comments**: same as C++, both multiline and inline.

=== Data types ===
* JavaScript is dynamically typed.
* There are 8 data types:
1. ''number'' - For both integers and floats.
2. ''bigint''
3. ''string'' - both quotes are OK. Concatenation using ''+''. Strings can be like numbers(and vice versa). e.g. '''2.3'*2 = 4.6''. [[./pasted_image001.png|Escape]] character same as C++. Strings can span multiple lines.
4. ''boolean''(''true''/''false'')
5. ''Symbol''
6. ''undefined'' - not been assigned(garbage values are avoided this way)
7. ''null''
8. ''object'' - everything except the primitives is an ''object'', including functions, arrays etc.

* non-''object'' types are called primitve data types.
* All primitives(except null and undefined) have an object equivalent.

Note:
	* An ''object'' in JS is simply a hashmap with key-value pairs. A key is always a ''string'', and a value can be anything including strings, integers, booleans, functions, other objects etc.
	* All primitives are immutable.
	* ''NaN'' - result of number • nonNumber. It is a number.
	* ''Infinity'' - a ''number''.

=== Variables ===
There are 3 kinds of variable declarations in JS:
* **let** - simple variable(scoping same as C++). Example ''let x = 2;''
* **const** - non reassignable variable(data structure is still mutable). Same as C++. Example ''const k = 32;''
* **var **- variable declaration(not initialization). Discouraged.

Note:
	a. Avoid using ''var'', except when working with old codebases.
	b. Uninitalized(undefined) variables store the value ''undefined''😁️.
	c. Internally, //let, const //and// var, function, function*, class //are **all** [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31219420/are-variables-declared-with-let-or-const-hoisted/31222689#31222689|hoisted]]
	d. JavaScript has only two scopes - global(unique), local(changes).
	e. All inner scopes can read/write variables from outer scope. Just like C++.
	f. Declarations can be chained.

=== ''var'' vs ''let'' ===
* The only difference is that var has a function scope, a more free scope. i.e it can leak out of top-level blocks, but not out of the function.
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
if(true)
	var x = 2;
console.log(x); // prints 2, as x leaked out from the block

if(true)
	let x = 2; // x is a block scope, so it ends here. Just like C++
console.log(x); // Error x is undefined
}}}

* So ''var'' has only two anomalies(w.r.t C++):
	a. It leaks out of non-function blocks(conditionals, loops).
	b. It can be redeclared.

=== Hoisting(JS feature) ===
* A JavaScript interpreter performs many things behind the scene, "hoisting" is one of them.
* Hoisting: functions and variables in the current scope are intrepreted before code execution.
* If you are not aware of this “hidden” behavior, it can cause a lot of confusion. 
* The best way of thinking about the behavior of JavaScript variables is to always visualize them as consisting of two parts: a declaration and an assignment.

=== Standard IO ===
**Output** 
* ''console.log(variable)'' - just like ''print()'' in Python3(newlines, virial). Works for both CLI and browser.
* ''alert(variable)'', for the browser. Alert is blocking: you have to click OK or press the Enter key.
**Input**
* ''prompt('message', defaultAnswer)'' - same as ''input()'' in Python3. only for the browser.

=== Operators ===
* All operators are the same(symbol and rules) as C++(bitwise, relational, increment/decrement(post and pre)), with some changes:
	* Equality(string equivalent) - ''=='' and ''!=''
	* Equality(of value and type) - ''==='' and ''!==''
	* ''**'' does exponentiation of numbers.
	* ''>>>'' - makes the number unsigned after the shift.
* Shorthand operators are allowed.
* Assignment expressions are allowed.

=== Code indentation and statements ===
* **Semicolons** are required at end of a statement. It won't break the code, but recommended.
* JS if free-form - Code blocks are {}, and consequently we need () for **for**, **while **etc  - Just like C++.

=== Conditionals ===
* //if//, //else//, //else if//, //ternary operator(?:;)// - same as C++
* //switch - //same as// C++//
* JS does have a concept of truthy values.

=== Loops ===
* //for//, //while//, //do while - same as C++//
* //continue// and //break// mean the same as C++.

=== Functions ===
* No return/parameter type required.
* Keyword ''function'' is used - like ''def'' in Python3
* Name may be skipped for IIFE.
* Default params are allowed in JS, rules same as C++.
* Functions are always hoisted.
* **return** ends the function(obviously). Every function returns ''undefined'', if return is absent.
**Syntax**
1. Named function
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
function foo(bar1, bar2)
{
	// code
}
}}}

2. Anonymous functions(lambda) - storing function in variables.
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
let x = function(){ // function name not necessary
	return 2;
};	

x(); // calling
}}}

3. IIFE - short form of lambda. No storing required.
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
( // prefix parenthesis is required here.
	function(bar)
	{ /* code */ }
)(); // calling parenthesis is out of function object
}}}
