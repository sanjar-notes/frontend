# 6. Meta tags
Created Tuesday 01 September 2020

### Why
These tags are placed inside `<head></head>`. 
They're mostly used for 
1. SEO (Search engine optimization) related things. Meta tags describe additional information, which is very useful for web crawler.
2. Link previews of the site (like on WhatsApp)

### Syntax
```html
<meta name="author" content=""/>
```
