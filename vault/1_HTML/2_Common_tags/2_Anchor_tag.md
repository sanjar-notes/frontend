Created Wednesday 17 June 2020

### Why
Used for linking to other pages.
Syntax: `<a href=""> </a>` is used for making links.

### What can it link to:
1. Other URLs/html pages
2. Files
3. Link element on the same page, using id attribute of destination. Syntax: ``<a href="#idname"></a>``. Jump, no reloads üòÉÔ∏è!
4. Email address, phone number, SMS.
	1. Email - [``mailto:example@gmail.com``](mailto:example@gmail.com)``?subject=Subject&body=Content``
	2. SMS - ``sms:1234567890?body=Content``
	3. Phone call - ``tel:1234567890``
	4. WhatsApp - `whatsapp://send?text=my message&phone=+919123456789`, `whatsapp://send?text=Hello%20World!`
5. Custom schemes. Especially relevant for xdg-open or Android intent.

This opens the relevant app. subject and body may be skipped.
* *Huge Plus*: As anchor is an open tag, We can set images to act as links, and technically anything.

### Other attributes
1. `<a target="_blank"></a>` opens the link in new tab. It has 3 more values, see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#target).
2. `<a download></a>` boolean attribute will download the file. Of course the `href` needs to be a valid file.

### Relative vs absolute address/paths
* Relative is based current folder address.
* Absolute is based on the root (/home or analogue) folder.
