# 2. Colors
Created Monday 15 June 2020

There are three ways to define color:

1. **rgb(r,g,b)** - where 0 ≤r, g, b ≤ 255.
2. **#pqrstu** - 0≤ all values ≤ f
3. **Names** - blue, green, fuchsia
4. **hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)** - hue ∈ [0, 360), saturation ∈ [0, 100], lightness ∈ [0, 100]
5. **hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)** - for transparency


Notes:

1. For grayscale - use the same color for all red, green and blue.

2. There are about 140 names supported by HTML/CSS
3. **rgba(r,g,b, alpha) **is used 0≤α≤1 to allow transparency with alpha = **1 being the most opaque**. It's got nothing to do with the rgb values.
4. Shortened hex(only some cases such as #AABBCC becomes #ABC)
