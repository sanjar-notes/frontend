# 0. Miscellaneous
Created Monday 15 June 2020

Misc properties:
1. opacity: 0.3 âˆˆ \[0, 1\], 1 for the most opaque. This applies to the whole element(and its children).
2. `cursor` - `default`, `grab`, `grabbing`, `pointer`, `progress`.
3. To keep aspect ratio for images, set `image-width:100%`. Especially useful in case of flexbox.
4. `user-select`: `none` disables selection of text, good for making pages non-edit like.
