# 2. grid item position
Created Thursday 03 September 2020


* The **justify-self** property specifies position of the cell in the horizontal direction.
* The **align-self** property specifies position of the cell in the vertical direction.


Both have 4 options:

1. stretch - the default value
2. center - at center
3. start - sets the position to the left or top
4. end - sets the position to the right or bottom

* The properties have the name self, because they are used for the items.
