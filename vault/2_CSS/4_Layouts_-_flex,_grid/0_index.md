# 4. Layouts - flex, grid
Created Sunday 25 April 2021

### Why
Laying out children in an element was hard in CSS for a long time. 
`display: flex` and `display: grid` solved that problem.

In simple words - with this knowledge, one can control/set nested elements as 1D or a 2D block, and with automatic responsive behavior for the children being layed out.
