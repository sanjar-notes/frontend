# 5. align self
Created Saturday 23 October 2021

### Why
Control cross axis position for a flex-item.

### How
``align-item`` and set its values, same as cross axis 5 values.

Note:
*There is no justify-self in flex*, see [issue](https://github.com/sanjar-notes/web_dev_fundamentals/issues/83). Workaround for item at opposite side than others is to use `margin` on a side with `auto`.
