# 2. cross axis
Created Wednesday 02 September 2020

Cross axis = perpendicular to direction of flex (main axis)
``align-items`` controls components along the cross axis.

It has 5 modes:
1. center → all components stacked at the center, same space on both ends.
2. flex-start → all components stacked at the start
3. flex-end → all components stacked at the end
4. stretch → All elements are streched fully along the cross axis. It is the default for align-items, if not specified.
5. baseline → All components have the same baseline(line where letters sit). See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/q/34606879/11392807) for clarification.
