Created Wednesday 02 September 2020

The ``flex-wrap`` property is used for wrapping [the](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/use-the-flex-wrap-property-to-wrap-a-row-or-column) components.
It applies w.r.t the main axis only - as it is for reading, and therefore has no cross-axis. property.

It has 3 values (modes):
1. no-wrap → The default
