# 6. display and visibility
Created Tuesday 16 June 2020


### `display`
There are 3 options: none, inline, block,
* Most elements have a predfined, default value.
* Can be used to remove elements by setting dislay:none without removing them.

### `visibility`
* visibility:none, just makes the element contents hidden, it still takes the screen real estate.


### `hidden` attribute on tags
FIXME: add this (may help: https://github.com/sanjar-notes/web_dev_fundamentals/issues/101), and clean up display and visiblity non hiding usage too.
