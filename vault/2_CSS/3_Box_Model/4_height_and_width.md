# 4. height and width
Created Tuesday 16 June 2020


* height and width are for content (and not related or affected by padding, margin or border).
* **box-sizing: border-box; **helps to make the border box okay. Content is distorted, the element size changes only if the padding is greater than either height or width.
* limit the width and/or height of an element using **max-width **and the **max-height **property.
* We can also set the minimum width and height, using **min-width **or **min-height**

FIXME: handle min, fit, max, 100% and clear pareto based understanding.
