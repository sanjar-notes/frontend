# 1. JS Setup
Created Tuesday 14 July 2020

#### **No-setup method**
- Open developer tool aka DevTool, in a browser.
- Write JS in console

#### **Dedicated setup(in the terminal)**
- JavaScript needs the `node.js` interpreter to run outside the browser.
- **Steps for installing node**

Install **nvm**: easy to update/manage node versions. Similar to pyenv.
Install `node` using **`nvm`** by running the following command
nvm install insert_latest_version --lts

`npm`(Node Package Manager) comes bundled with `node`
check version using `node -v`

Note:

- Node is similar to the Python interpreter.
- `node` is used for summoning the JavaScript REPL, at a CLI.
- `npm` is used for installing node(javascript) packages. You don't need it for learning the JavaScript language.
