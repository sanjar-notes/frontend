# 6. display and visibility
Created Tuesday 16 June 2020

display: Assume that the element is absent.
There are 3 options: none, inline, block

* Most elements have a predfined, default value.
* Can be used to remove elements by setting dislay:none without removing them.


*****

Visibility: The element just went blind.

* visibility:none, just makes the element contents hidden, it still takes the screen real estate.
