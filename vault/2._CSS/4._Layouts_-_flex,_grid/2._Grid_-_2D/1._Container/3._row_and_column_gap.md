# 3. row and column gap
Created Thursday 03 September 2020

There are two options:

1. grid-column-gap
2. grid-row-gap
3. grid-gap - If one value is specified, it applies to both(row and col respectively). Else specify both values.


* Just set them in the grid container
* They specify the gap **between** rows and columns.
