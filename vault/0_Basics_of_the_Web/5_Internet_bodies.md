### Key Points:

- **IETF** is focused on voluntary Internet standards, particularly in network protocols like TCP/IP.
- **IANA** primarily manages critical Internet resources, including IP addresses and DNS.
- **W3C** develops standards for the World Wide Web, focusing on technologies like HTML and CSS.
- **WHATWG** specializes in web standards, emphasizing the living standards for HTML and DOM.
- **ICANN** coordinates the global DNS system and manages Internet naming and addressing systems.
- **ISO** and **IEEE** are broader in scope but include key standards for networking, data formats, and telecommunications.
- **ETSI** focuses on European ICT standards and plays a significant role in technologies like 5G.
- **Browser** is a user application that people use to surf the web graphically. Its the bedrock for websites as well as UI apps.
- **Node.js** is the most popular server side JavaScript runtime. It runs on all major operating systems and hardware. Its known for its high speed and ability to handle huge RPS due to a non-blocking architecture.

These organizations collaborate and overlap in various areas to ensure the Internet and related technologies function effectively worldwide.
