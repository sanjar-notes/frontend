# 2. Map, filter and reduce
Created Thursday 25 March 2021

#### Why use map, filter or reduce?

* Map, filter and reduce help us to make our code functionally pure(deterministic).


#### 1. Map

* Purpose - store f(ele) for each element, in a **map object**.
* Syntax - ``arr.map(f)``; where f can be a function in any form.
* Assume an argument when defining f.
* f(ele) is computed and stored for each element. ``undefined`` is stored if ``f`` returns nothing.
* The map object is index subscriptable.

#### 2. Filter

* Purpose - returns an iterable of elements for which f(ele) is true.
* Syntax - same as map.

#### 3. Reduce

* Purpose - Accumulates the result by running f(accum,ele) for each element.
* Syntax - ``arr.reduce(f, accum_start=0)``
* You must have *accumulator* and *element* as parameters of ``f``, in order.

	const arr = [1, 2, 3]
	const res = arr.reduce(((accum, ele)=> accum + ele), accum_init_value); // 0 if unspecified
	// same as doing accum = accum + ele each time


* Remember update accum inside f().

Note: 

* All the quick for functions - **forEach**, **map**, **filter** and **reduce** work sequentially by default. They can be made parallel, however.
* Iteration number is available all **forEach**, **map** and **filter **- as the second parameter of ``f``. This is optional.


#### Gotchas

* ``map`` and ``filter`` return an Array of outputs, while ``reduce`` returns a single value.
* Use these anytime we need loops for small things.
* forEach is different, it returns nothing.
