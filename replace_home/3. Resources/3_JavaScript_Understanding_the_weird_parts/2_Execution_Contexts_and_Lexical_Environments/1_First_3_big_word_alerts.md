# 1. First 3 big word alerts
Created Sunday 20 February 2022

The first 3 "big word alerts" to be discussed in this video are:
1. Syntax Parsers
2. Execution Contexts
3. Lexical  Environments

What are these things, let's see:
1. Syntax Parsers - a program that reads source code and checks if the syntax of it is correct. It may do extra stuff too, as specified by the syntax parser's creators.
2. Lexical Environment - the tree structure of scopes.
3. Execution Context - the current stack frame.

I was confused between 2 and 3, as the course author does not use the word 'activation record' or 'frame.' [This](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35760441/11392807) cleared it.

These things are important. They'll help us understand what's going inside JavaScript.
