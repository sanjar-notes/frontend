# 2. Anchor tag
Created Wednesday 17 June 2020

#### Why
Used for linking to other pages.
Syntax:

* ``<a href=""> </a>`` is used for making links.


#### What can it link to:

1. Other URL's/html pages
2. Files
3. Link element on the same page, using id attribute of destination. Syntax: ``<a href="#idname"></a>``. Jump, no reloads üòÉÔ∏è!
4. Email address, phone number, SMS.
	1. Email - [``mailto:example@gmail.com``](mailto:example@gmail.com)``?subject=Subject&body=Content``
	2. SMS - ``sms:1234567890?body=Content``
	3. Phone call - ``tel:1234567890``

This opens the relevant app.
subject and body may be skipped.


* *Huge Plus*: As anchor is an open tag, We can set images to act as links, and technically anything.
