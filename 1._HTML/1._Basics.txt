=== What is HTML ===
* It is a language used to specify the structure(skeleton) of a webpage.
* HTML is a markup language, not a programming language.
* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language

=== Tags ===
* The basic unit of HTML is the tag.
* There are two kinds of tags
	a. Content tags(or just tags)
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<p> HTML is genius </p>
}}}

	b. Self closing(or empty tags)
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<img />
}}}


=== Attributes ===
* An attribute is a key-value pair that modifies the behavior of a tag.
* They are written inside the opening angled brackets.
* Syntax:
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<img height="200px" width="200px" />
}}}

* Parts of an attribute:
	a. key - a string without quotes.
	b. value - a string with quotes.
	''='' is used for assigning values to key.
* Rules for attributes:
	* Attributes are separated by space.
	* Ordering of attributes does not matter.
* Presence of a boolean attribute means it is enabled.
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<video autoplay="true" /> <!-- verbose -->

<video autoplay /> <!-- concise is better -->
}}}


=== Anatomy of a webpage ===
* There are 3 basic tags in all webages.
	1. ''html'' - encloses the whole webpage.
	2. ''head'' - contains title(tab title) and page metadata. Used by crawlers.
	3. ''body'' - webpage content, as seen in the browser.
* Basic structure of a webpage.
{{{code: lang="html" linenumbers="True"
<!DOCTYPE html> <!--Ignore this for now-->

<html>

	<head>
	</head>
	
	<body>
	</body>
	
</html>
}}}

* Everything inside the ''body'' is visible(perceptible) in the browser(below the omnibox).
* The preamble, ''<!DOCTYPE html>'' is used for legacy reasons. It's not a part of the webpage and just describes the file type.

=== Other basic tags ===
* ''title'' - appears on the tab. Page file name is displayed if this is absent. Used within ''head''.
* ''meta'' - self closing tag specifying metadata like language, region, character encoding etc.

=== Facts about HTML ===
* Errors are ignored by the browser. [[https://youtu.be/-csXdj4WVwA|See]](optional).
* Whitespace is ignored in the content of HTML tags, except in string literals.
* HTML does not have strict indentation, it is free flow language.
