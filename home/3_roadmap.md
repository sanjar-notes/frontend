# 4. Roadmap
Created Friday 25 December 2020

<details> <summary>Arnav's Course</summary>

Full stack
Front End - embrace it, good eye for Design
Back End - Dev Ops

# 1st Pass

## Front End

- runs inside a browser(HTML, CSS, JS - only these but very important)(MDN web docs), w3schools(used for basics),
- (2 weeks) CSS - Box model, [tranforms, transitions, animations], layout[flexbox, grid, @media],
- JS - (2 weeks) data types, equality, DOM ops, events, timeout, submit, split splice join, event loop(Philip Roberts, Carbon Five)
- Learn Fundas of both Front and back, then do the intermediate things in both, then do advanced in Both, Then libraries

- Front end and backend cannot be done in isloation

## Back End

- documentation is nodejs is nodejs.org
- (1 week) nodejs - runtime for javascript based on V8, without the browser. This is faster than Python, around 10x
- It was so fast that it became fit for desktop apps, even embedded apps
- Maybe comparable to Java. Once a lang is fast, it is also used for making servers
- Nodejs vs JS --> window, document is not available. process and global is available on desktop.
- npm - very easy and useful tool
- modules
- how _require_ works
- Native API: fs, events, os, http
  (End of one week)
- freeCodeCamp is a good resource

- OSI model
- HTTP methods
- Fundamental of server-client - theoretical

## Servers with Node JS(3 weeks)

- How are REST APIs made - using Express.js, used to make servers
  - Routes
  - Middlewares
  - templates - Hbs(handle bars), Ejs, SSR(Server Side Rendering)
- DB
  _ SQL vs NoSQL, which to use and when to use it.
  _ CAP Theorem, PACELC theorem
  _ MySQL or Postgres - SQL
  _ NoSQL - MongoDB, CassandraDB
  _ SQL commands - trickery
  _ query, $sort in mongoDB
  Ready to make CRUD websites

# 2nd Pass

## Front End(2 weeks)

- CSS libaries - Bootstrap, Materialize - professional sites
- jQuery - Very good tool, not used to create big tools
- axios - js library, https requests asynchronously

## Back End

(Start of 2 weeks)

- static or public HTML
- HBS+data -> SSR
- form submissions
- POST request body -> URL encoded, JSON
  (End of two weeks)
  (Start of 2 weeks)
- Sessions - log in state, need to understand how these works
  - Cookies
  - Tokens
  - localStorage
  - session storage used on front end
- Authentication vs Authorization
- OAuth2.0 - helps and used at FaceBook, Twitter and Google
  (End of two weeks)

## Make project(any one - 1 week)

    Blogging site - comments
    Social media

## (1 week) Realtime apps - WebSocket(change without req-res) - learn - from socket.io.

- (1 week) make Collab IDE, Shared Whiteboard

## Good to know - browser API

- Canvas -> 2D games
- Browser APIs - GPS, A/V

# 3rd pass

## Testing

### FE

- Jasmine, JEST, Karma(automated test)
- UI TEst - phantomJS(screenshot tests), puppeteer(headless testing), protractor
- FE - Frameworks - React, Vue, Ember, Angular - Components, Routing, State Management(Just these three)

### BE - testing

- Mocha + Chai
- NYC - code coverage(runs tests when code is updated), testing is very, very important.

### Deployment and DevOps

- handle, nginx configs
- handle, Apache configs
- Well versed with Linux - like firewalls, not basic stupid stuff
- Setup database - Mongo, MySQL, postgres

### Containerization

- Docker - Modularization of OS and dependencies, programmatically managing resources(software)
- Kubernetes(K8S) - Orchestrization framework
- Chef, ansible

## DevOps Services - Free/Paid

- Serverless - AWS lambda
- IaaS - Machine is given(configure yourself) - Google Compute Engine, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean
- PaaS - Worry only about the code - Heroku, Google App Engine, AWL LightSail
- BaaS - (backend existing, push notifications) Firebase
- Static Web Hosting - GitHuib pages, Netlify, versel(now.sh)
- Automation - Travis CI/ Github actions

# Deployment to DevOps is a part of SRE(Site Reliability Engineer) - bare minimum

---

MAD as a web developer without Android, Flutter

- Web App wrappers(PWA)
- Ionic --> Hybrid Apps
- React Native

---

Desktop Apps

- Electron.js - Spotify, Slack, VSCode

IoT and Electronics

- johhnyify, p0

His story
Learn from hackathons
Maybe not in a fundamental way, but it is important
https://online.codingblocks.com/courses/web-development-online-course

Arnav suggests looking at free content first. MDN, CSSTricks, there should be returns
SRE/FullStack are highest paid - Flock, RazorPay, Zeta, UrbanClap, Zomato, Swiggy, Flipkart, HotStar, DoubtNut
FAANG have stock(which is great)

---

Additional langs

- TS
- SASS or LESS
- YDKJS
- cb.lk/yt/jsadv ot/jsbasics

---

CodeWithHarry

- Learn 80% HTML, 60% CSS and 50% JS(avoid promises, callbacks)
- Learn PHP to get concepts, then use JS/Ruby/Python3
- Don't use frameworks, website builders(like WiX), 3rd part libraries
- Design and Web Dev are independent. Take inspiration from websites
- HTMLCheatSheet.com
- CodePen.io - learn things

# This is great

* Python vs Node is not important
