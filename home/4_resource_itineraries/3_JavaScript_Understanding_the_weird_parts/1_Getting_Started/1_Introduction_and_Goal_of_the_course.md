To understand JavaScript, and not Nodejs or browser stuff - so the language.

It is expected that I have very basic knowledge of JS - like variables, loops, function basics.

Note: Also, any words that seem difficult and grand but are actually represent simple things are called will be tagged using "big word alert" symbol.
