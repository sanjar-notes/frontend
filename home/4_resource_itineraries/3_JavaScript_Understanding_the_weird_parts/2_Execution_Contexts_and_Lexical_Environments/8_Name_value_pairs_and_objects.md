- Objects are very important in JavaScript.
- We need to understand and distinguish between the terms:
	1. Name-value pair - a name which maps to a single value. This is the basic for variables. This is singular.
	2. Object - a "collection" of name value pairs.
- Other programming languages may have other notions of Objects, but in JavaScript, it means a collection of name-value pairs.
- Value of a name may be an object (collection of name value pairs) itself, that's fine. Simply said, nesting is possible.
