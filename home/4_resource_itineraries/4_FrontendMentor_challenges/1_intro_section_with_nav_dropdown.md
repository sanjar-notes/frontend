# 1. Intro section with dropdown navigation

[Challenge link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5/hub/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-nf9va42mE1)

### Learnings
1. Question: what to implement first, small components or the large layouts/components. i.e. bottom-up or top-down. This is valid when starting with any UI.
2. Confidence gain: I can work with layouts quite nicely.
3. Problem: brush up box-model, i.e. does width(or height) include border/padding/margin? How to remember this?

### Todo
Have to implement UI that'll render properly on mobile (which is completely different). 
1. How is this done?
2. Are media queries enough?
3. Can a page have a switch case where each device has a different UI which is rendered selectively, or is it all mixed up.

How is a custom styled dropdown created ?
I am yet to create this.

1. Using `z-index` and `display: none`?
2. Or something else.
3. Note that dropdown `select`, `option` are OS controlled, and cannot be styled extensively.
