# 6. Understanding and frameworks
Created Sunday 20 February 2022
- [ ] in vault.

JavaScript is being for very powerful, awesome libraries and frameworks like Express.js, Angular.js, React.js and more.

- Developers get introduced to JavaScript details via these libraries and frameworks, i.e. JavaScript is not studied in isolation.
- This has an effect that the learner does not get a very good understanding of core JavaScript, but only the parts relevant to their library/framework.
- As we are studying JavaScript in isolation here, we will be studying all of core JavaScript, so that we understand the files of these libraries/frameworks.
- We will also be creating out own library at the end of this course.
