There are two kinds of variable types in JavaScript:
1. Primitive types - just values
2. Objects - name, value pairs. Value may be an object itself.

There are 7 types of primitive types in JS, at the point of this writing:
1. `undefined` - non-existence of a value, given by the JS engine. Should not be assigned to by us. Checking for it is fine though.
2. `null` - non-existence of a value. This can be assigned by us.
3. `number` - a floating type number.
4. `string` - a string of characters. Immutable because there is no `char` in JS.
5. `boolean` - obvious
6. `symbol` - ES6+, FIXME. We are ignoring this in this course.
7. `bigint` FIXME
