[Challenge link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5/hub/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-nf9va42mE1)

### Learnings
1. Question: what to implement first, small components or the large layouts/components. i.e. bottom-up or top-down. This is valid when starting with any UI.
2. Confidence gain: I can work with layouts quite nicely.
3. Problem: brush up box-model, i.e. does width(or height) include border/padding/margin? How to remember this?
