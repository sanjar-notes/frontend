====== 6. jQuery - trivia ======
Created Monday 13 July 2020

* What is jQuery - a DOM manipulation library.
* Why jQuery 
	1. Eliminates cross-browser incompatibilities.
	2. It facilitates the separation of HTML and JS.
	3. Extensibility - methods and elements can be reused.
	4. Brevity - new kinds of events and other properties are available.
* How does it look?
	a. jQuery is added inside a script tag.

		Explanation: This is equivalent to setting the eventListener to the p tag.
	b. For running jQuery, we need to attach the library.
		{{./pasted_image001.png}}
* What's the issue with jQuery:
	1. It made the code very imperative - the developer had to account for every action and the consequences, which includes the user's actions. For big websites, this becomes a huge mess.

		**The pyramid of Doom**
--------------------
* In a nutshell, we had HTML, CSS and JS. Then we had jQuery. As time progressed, people have made new things and much better libraries which have made working with JS much easier.
* Today - there are very few new projects which use jQuery.
* Developers who know only jQuery are not in high demand, and job postings are decreasing.
--------------------
**What is better, and consequently popular now?**
* We'll use a better, open source library called **React.js** - It is very popular and efficient(computationally awa from a development perspective).
* It is declarative.

Note: We **won't** be using DOM manipulations from now on.
