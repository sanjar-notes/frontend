====== 11. Modules in JS ======
Created Saturday 18 July 2020

=== Why ===
For:
* Avoid namespace pollution
* Reuse of code
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction

=== What is a module ===
A module is just a bit of code encapsulated in a file, and exported to another file.

=== How ===

=== - ES6 ===
* Let us first see where are we now:
1. We had inline scripts in HTML - Reusability, pollution of the global namespace
2. We had script tags src - Order has to be decided beforehand(dependency resolution), we have to keep the script tags in all HTML files, global namespace is polluted.
3. Using IIFE, we have no pollution, but order is not important.
4. Browserify, before deployment, this app bundled all of the JS files into a single massive file called bundle.js. This way, we wouldn't have to worry about the namespace etc.
5. In ES6 using Webpack, we can use export and import - Makes code easy to maintain.
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
// js1
export const add = (a, b) => a+b;
//OR
export default function add(a, b){
	return a+b;
}

//js2
import {add} from './add'; // if normal 'export'
//OR
import add from './add'; // if 'export default'

import add as k from "./add"

import * as bundled from "./add"
}}}


=== - Common JS modules ===
The ES6 syntax has not been implemented in CommonJS (the standard for modules that Node follows). An **old** syntax is followed by Node.
* Source: Everything to be exported is exported in a single object, called ''module.exports''
* Destination: Needed stuff is accessed from the export object using the ''require'' function.
That's all.
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
// Export - Source file
const largeNumber = 5;
module.exports = {
	largeNumber: largeNumber;
} // everything to be exported is sent as an object


// Import - Destination file
const { largeNumbers } = require("source_file_path");
const a = largeNumbers;
a // can be used
}}}

=== If CommonJS is what JS used, how does React use ES6 syntax? ===
* Browsers don't understand CommonJS, as they're not Node. 
* Consequently, apps written in Node.js's JavaScript needs to be transpiled to vanilla JS. 
* This is where compilers like [[3. JavaScript:3. Advanced JS:2. ES5 and ES6|Babel]] come in: they can receieve input in any way.
* And ES6 is set as input, and is compiled to CommonJS.

Evidence: create-react-app installs [[https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs|babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs]].
