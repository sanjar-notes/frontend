====== C. JS exclusive features ======
Created Thursday 25 March 2021

=== 1. Symbol data type ===
* Useful when working with objects.
* Used to create properties in objects which are invisible to the object owner.
* This is important if different people work on the same object. Separation of concerns is the goal, symbols avoid properties to clash, if the object is handled by two scripts.
* There is a global symbol registry, syntax, Symbol.for('id') is used to get the key for id, this is useful if we want some symbols to be the same in a team where a project has many teams.
* Symbol() don't auto-convert to strings, which is why obj[id1] is different for different people.
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
id = Symbol('id'); // desciption does not affect the hash value
const obj = {
	[id]: 23; 
}

// we can add our own properties to an existing object
id1 = Symbol();
obj[id1] = 231; // not accessible to the original user even if he uses property name as id1
}}}
FIXME	

=== 2. use ''strict'' ===
* Purpose - Generates more exceptions that usual. Usable for **whole scripts** or **functions**. [[https://johnresig.com/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/|See]].
* Syntax - add ''"use strict"'' on top of the function, script, class.
* Example
{{{code: lang="js" linenumbers="True"
// Example 1 - Globally
"use strict"; // for the whole script

/* code*/

// Example 2 - Selective
function f()
{
	"use strict"; // for the function
	// code 
}
function g()
{
	/*code*/ // no effect of "strict"
}
}}}
