# 2. Closures
Created Thursday 25 March 2021

#### Why
- Many a times, functions need to have some state. This is done using `static` variables in `C++`.
- **This construct of a function and it's state, is called a closure.**
- Closures help in avoiding global variables.

#### How
- Create some variables and a function in a scope. Then store the function in a variable, by returning the function in the scope. This "stored" function is a closure.
- One can also have a closure generator, i.e. a factory of "functions with a state".
- State is saved in heap memory, and is freed when the variable storing the function goes out of scope.

Example - counter without a global variable, using closure.
```javascript
let Base = function () {
	let counter = 0;
	return function () { 
		counter+=1; 
		console.log(counter);
	}
}

let add = Base(); // closure instance created
add() // 1
add() // 2
add() // 3

// We can have more closures too.
let plus = Base();

console.log(plus === add) // false, closure instances are different
```
