====== 1. Pure functions ======
Created Thursday 25 March 2021

=== What are pure functions? ===
* Have a single purpose.
* Should be free from side-effects(i.e change to external variables), as much as possible.
* Always return something.

=== How to write pure functions? ===
* Use ''const'' and avoid using ''function'' keyword as much as possible.
* This makes our code deterministic(each function is a mathematical function, not just a relation), and consequently more robust.
