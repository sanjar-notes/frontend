====== 1. JS Setup ======
Created Tuesday 14 July 2020

=== **No-setup method** ===
* Open developer tool aka DevTool
* Write JS in console

=== **Dedicated setup(in the terminal)** ===
* JavaScript needs the ''node.js'' interpreter to run outside the browser.
* **Steps for installing node**
Install **nvm**: easy to update/manage node versions. Similar to pyenv.
	2. Install ''node'' using **''nvm''** by running the following command
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
nvm install latest_version --lts
}}}

	3. ''npm''(Node Package Manager) comes bundled with ''node''
	4. check version using ''node -v''

Note: 
* Node is similar to the Python interpreter.
* ''node'' is used for summoning the JavaScript REPL, at a CLI.
* ''npm'' is used for installing node(javascript) packages. You don't need it for learning the JavaScript language.
