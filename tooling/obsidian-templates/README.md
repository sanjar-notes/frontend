This folder is meant for obsidian templates.

## Templater plugin

- I keep the templater plugins here as well. [Templater help](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/issues/397#issuecomment-1712749066)
- I've added empty hotkey enties into templater and have attached them as top command palette options.
- If templates increase, I'll need to use the 'Templater: insert template modal'. *Palette term 'modal' is enough*
