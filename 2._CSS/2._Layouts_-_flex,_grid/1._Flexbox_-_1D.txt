====== 1. Flexbox - 1D ======
Created Tuesday 16 June 2020

=== Why flexbox? ===
Control/set contained elements in a single row/column.

Helps us keep everything at the correct place(in a row or in a column - 1D), without explicit settings. 
* Saves us a lot of time, and is responsive.
* We'll not be using the older things, mostly.

Two great resources are:
1. CSS Tricks - Flexbox
2. Flexbox froggy - a game to play with the flexbox
--------------------

=== flexbox container (in row mode, the default) ===
{{./pasted_image.png}}
--------------------

=== The axes and controls ===
The main axis and cross axis have nothing to do with horizontal/vertical. 
They are set via the ''flex-direction'' property, default is row.
* main axis is along the ''flex-direction''. Control for main axis is via the ''justify-content'' property.
* cross axis is perpendicular to main axis. Conrtol for cross axis is via the ''align-items'' property. 
--------------------

=== There are two kinds of things to control in flex ===
1. For the flex container - for positioning and laying out space to the flex items
2. For the flex items - for setting their dimensions, optionally overriding container flex properties.
