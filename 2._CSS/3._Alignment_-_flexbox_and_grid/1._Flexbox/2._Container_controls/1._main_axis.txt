====== 1. main axis ======
Created Wednesday 02 September 2020

All of this can be done by the **justify-content** property. This changes the components w.r.t the main axis
It has 6 modes:
1. center → all components stacked at the center.
2. flex-start → all components stacked at the start
3. flex-end → all components stacked at the end
4. space-between → All elements have the same space between them. No space at the two ends.
5. space-around → Same as space between but, there's space/2 space at the ends too.
6. space-evenly → Distributes the space evenly, with space at the ends too.
