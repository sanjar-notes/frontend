====== 6. CSS calc function ======
Created Wednesday 03 November 2021

=== Why ===
Allows calculations in CSS, for different length units.

=== How ===
Syntax:
{{{code: lang="css" linenumbers="True"
selector{
	font-size: calc(32px + 10vm);
	width: calc(100px + var(--oldwidth));
}
}}}

* Inputs can be same too, but that's useless.
* Multiplications can be done to.
* CSS Variables can be used.

NOTE: Addition and subtraction need whitespace between operators. üõëÔ∏è

=== Applications of calc ===
* Dynamically control stuff: font-sizes with ''vw'' (view width).
