====== 4. Critical Render Path ======
Created Tuesday 16 June 2020

* We always should know how things work underneath the hood to know how things happen.
Suppose we have the following setup:
{{./pasted_image.png}}
We're using an external google-font style file.
The process:
1. HTML is sent - It requests for the CSS we built. 
	{{./pasted_image001.png}}
	{{./pasted_image002.png}}
	
2. It then encounters the google-style sheet, and requests google.com.
	{{./pasted_image003.png}}
* As this is being done, the first CSS file **could **be used  - But this is not done, the items using CSS are not rendered until the CSS is there.
* CSS is a **render blocking file**
* We can avoid this by:
	1. Have our own font files
	2. Keeping the CSS file short - Minifying(removes all whitespaces, a one liner, used in js too)
