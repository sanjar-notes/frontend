# 2. margin and padding
Created Tuesday 16 June 2020

Margin are the space outside the tag boundary - Inter element boundary

* They are just like border - there are 4 of them
* We can use shorthand notation
* **auto** : makes the element horizontally at the center of the page. If set for all, makes the tag center horizontally.
* **inherit **: Inherits the parents value for the said margin(or all of them). Makes a cascade like pattern.


*****

margin collapse: Refers to the practice of setting one of the elements margin to 0 and the other to the max. Should be done only for vertical margins.


*****

**Padding**
This defines the space between the boundary and the contents of the element. Garden space.

* auto=0 for padding.
